# MathGame

This project was made for my son to practice for his 3rd Grade Multiplication Tests he takes weekly.

Largely an unfinished product, and i do not own any of the artwork or assets. This was not made for commercial use or distribution. It is just an attempt to show my son how cool coding is and help him practice while playing along with his favorite video game characters.
